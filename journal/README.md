# Link and Blurb (Journal) 

You may insert your link and blurb into this markdown document 

**Please include the screenshots in your journal for easy access.**

Your journal should include a blurb of text explaining 6 or more improvements you made, the problems you faced, how you fixed them, knowledge and wisdom you could pass to others doing the challenge, and anything else you can think to put in the document

Make your journal easy to read by putting: 

- overview of task (title)
- what you learned or what you did (explanation)
- problems you faced (what did you learn or what problems occurred)
- and how you solved them (explain what you did or how you solved the problem)
- screenshot showing what you learned or what you did 
- references (make sure you reference your work!!!)

The journal will be named “\<Pawprint\>Journal” with the corresponding file extension .md

For example: “Abc123Journal.md”

Your journal should be

- clear
- easy to read
- and be of some help

If the TAs are reading it, the journal should guide them through what you learned or what you did and it should show off how much you implemented and explored.

Do not submit a word document or a text file, make sure it is a nicely formatted MarkDown file otherwise you will get points taken off

Make sure your document is easy to read and using correct markdown
