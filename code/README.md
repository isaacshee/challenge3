# Code

You may insert your code into this directory

**The code that goes in this directory will be the raw code. Code that you can view in the editor.**

**Do not submit the builded code here.**

The build code will be uploaded to the server and you will submit the link in the blurb and on Canvas. 

When publishing your code on the server, export the code using `ng build --prod` 

Watch this YouTube video if you are not able to export or if you are getting the white screen of death: [https://youtu.be/bv16MMPI_S4](https://youtu.be/bv16MMPI_S4)
